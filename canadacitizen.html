            <h2>Best Citizenship Consultants at Your Service</h2>
            <p>Immigration law in Canada is a complicated and occasionally perplexing area. Requirements are often changing—sometimes even twice a year—and there is an excessive amount of documentation that makes it simple to lose track of. Although you can always do immigration on your own, it’s safer to work with a professional immigration consultant as they will save you a ton of time and money in the end. The following are some benefits of finishing your citizenship with SKYLARK, which might help you avoid needless delays in your case:
                
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="third">
            <h2>We Work on Accurately Filling out your documents.</h2>
            <p>There are many questions on application forms, and all of them should be addressed. Processing may be delayed by incomplete applications and missing information. Giving truthful responses is also crucial to preventing deception. Hiding information could keep you and your family from obtaining Canadian citizenship, even if it was just an inadvertent human error.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="fourth">
            <h2>We Guarantee Your Documents Will be Submitted Before the Deadline</h2>
            <p>In order to proceed with your application and bring you one step closer to a final decision, the processing office may occasionally require a few more papers. It’s crucial to keep in mind that they enforce deadlines strictly. Although you are often granted 30 days to submit any more paperwork, this isn’t always the case. Our office guarantees that your paperwork will be sent on time and without any delays.
                
                
               </p>
              
             
        </div>
        <div class="fifth">
            <h2>We Will Keep Track of Your Application and update you accordingly.</h2>
            <p>
                Our first goal is to keep you informed of your case’s progress. We understand the significance of knowing. Since the immigration procedure may be somewhat stressful, we make sure you are involved at every turn.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sixth">
            <h2>Permanent Resident Status</h2>
            <p>The countdown to citizenship begins the moment you obtain your PR card and become a permanent resident. Make sure you meet the time limit and have a valid PR status before submitting your citizenship application. One error might cost you a lot of time, and the application process as a whole can take years.

               
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="seven">
            <h2>Time you have lived in Canada</h2>
            <p>Prior to signing your application, you must have been a resident of Canada for a minimum of three years, or 1,095 days. If there are computation issues, the Canadian Citizenship and Immigration Service advises you to apply after more than three years of residence in Canada. You might be allowed to factor in the time you lived in Canada as a temporary resident when making your calculations.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="eight">
            <h2>How do I count the time lived in Canada?</h2>
            <p>
                
                
                
            <ul>
                <li>Count the days you were physically present in Canada</li>
                <li>Times, when you’ve been out of the country, are excluded (international trips, vacations, etc)</li>
                <li>You should keep track of days spent in Canada and days out for higher accuracy.</li>
                
            </ul>
            </p>
              
                
            
        </div>
        <div class="nine">
            <h2>Filing Income Taxes</h2>
            <p>Another prerequisite for Canadian citizenship is filing taxes, which you must do for at least three years before the date on which you apply to Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada for citizenship.

                
                
                Your employer is supposed to have sent you a T4 or T5 tax assessment form in January or February after the tax year ended.
                
                
                
                After the tax year ended, in January or February, you ought to have received a T4 from your company. You could be required to file a tax return even if you spent only a portion of the year in Canada.
                
                
                
                Remember that when you submit your citizenship application, you are giving Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada permission to get in touch with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to find out if you submitted your taxes on time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="ten">
            <h2>Pass a test on responsibilities, rights and knowledge of Canada</h2>
            <p>The passing of this test is one of the conditions for obtaining Canadian citizenship. You must take this citizenship test and respond to questions regarding the rights and obligations of Canada’s history, geography, economy, government, laws, and symbols if you are between the ages of 18 and 54 on the day you sign the application.

                
                
                There are 20 questions on the test, and you must get 15 of them right to pass. It lasts 30 minutes and is available in French or English. The following link (opens in a new window) provides the citizenship study guide, which contains the information used to build the test:
                
                
                
                Numerous websites offer practice exams in the form of online tests, which might aid in exam preparation. Here is a page where you can find out more about the exam.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="ten">
            <h2>Language skills, another Canadian citizenship requirement</h2>
            <p>English and French are the two official languages of Canada. If you sign the application and are between the ages of 18 and 54, you will need to demonstrate that you can speak and listen in one of these languages at a certain level. You must abide by Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada’s citizenship requirements to become a citizen of Canada.</p>
