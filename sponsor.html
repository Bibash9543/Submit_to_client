                <h2>Family Sponsorship Canada</h2>
                <p>The main goal of this program is to facilitate the reunion of close family members with Canadian citizens, permanent residents and registered Indians.

                    
                    
                    Put simply, you are allowed to bring your spouse, common-law partner, conjugal partner, or dependent children into Canada if you are a citizen, permanent resident, or registered Indian.
                    
                    
                    
                    A family reunion is encouraged in Canada. Family reunification is still one of the primary tenets of the Canadian immigration system, and citizens and permanent residents of Canada have the chance to sponsor their family members to come to Canada through many immigration programs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="second2">
                <h2>Does obtaining a visitor's visa provide you with automatic entry into Canada?</h2>
                <p>No, the Canadian Border Services Agency officer at the port of entry makes the final decision. The
                    foreign national’s ability and willingness to depart Canada at the end of their visit must be
                    confirmed to the border services officer.

                    You might not be allowed to enter the nation if the office determines you don’t meet all of these
                    standards. But in actuality, this is an uncommon occurrence.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="third">
                <h2>Who Can Be a Sponsor Under the Family Sponsorship Program?</h2>
                <p>
                    You can become a sponsor if you meet all of the following criteria:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are 18 years of age or older</li>
                        <li>You are a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or a Registered Indian</li>
                        <li>You have the means to support your family member for 3+ years, depending on who you’re sponsoring.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="fourth">

            <div class="sixth">
                <h2>Your Obligations as a Sponsor</h2>
                <p>In Canada, there are responsibilities associated with sponsoring a family member. After obtaining permanent residency, the sponsoring Canadian citizen or permanent resident is required to execute an undertaking agreement and make a commitment to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to care for the sponsored family member for a predetermined amount of time.

                    
                    
                    As per the terms of the sponsorship agreement, you will be in charge of providing for the basic requirements of the person you are sponsoring, such as their clothing, food, and medical expenses that are not met by the public health services. In the event that they require social assistance from the government, you will have to reimburse that money.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="seven">
                <h2>Can I withdraw my sponsorship undertaking?</h2>
                <p>You are unable to revoke the undertaking if the individual you are sponsoring has already obtained permanent residency. Prior to the sponsorship application being processed, you may withdraw it, but the commitment cannot be canceled.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="eight">
                <h2>Spousal Sponsorship Canada</h2>
                <p>The following people must fit among these categories for a Canadian citizen or permanent resident to sponsor their spouse:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Spouse: legally valid marriage certificate under Canadian law and under the law where the marriage took place</li>
                        <li>Common-law partner: at least one year in a relationship</li>
                        <li>Conjugal partner: at least 12 months of conjugal relationship</li>
                        <li>Same-sex relationship: valid for immigration under the above categories</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
               
            </div>
            <div class="nine">
                <h2>Dependent Child Sponsorship Canada</h2>
                <p>If you want to sponsor your children, they must qualify as dependents, which means:

                    <ul>
                        <li>They are under the age of 22</li>
                        <li>They do not have a spouse or common-law partner</li>
                        <li>They were dependent on their parents for financial help before turning 22 and are now over the age of 22, unable to sustain themselves owing to a mental or physical ailment.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="ten">
                <h2>Sponsorship of Parents and Grandparents to Canada</h2>
                <p>Whether your parents are linked to you by blood or adoption, the sponsorship program will assist you in sponsoring them to become permanent residents of Canada if that is your wish.

                    
                    
                    If you are eligible to sponsor your parents and grandparents, the application intake for this program typically opens in the fall. Therefore, you must get ready before the program opens. Each year, only invited candidates can apply to sponsor their parents or grandparents due to a quota.
                    
                    
                    
                    We will be pleased to help you get ready and navigate the procedure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="eleven">
                <h2>Canada Sponsorship: Siblings, Nephews/Nieces, Grandchildren</h2>
                <p>A sponsorship program may be able to help your sisters, brothers, nieces, nephews, or grandkids who are unmarried, orphaned, and under the age of eighteen, to move to Canada.

                    
                    
                    With this sponsorship program, you can help your loved ones become permanent residents of lovely Canada and reconnect with them as long as you are a citizen or permanent resident of Canada, can financially support your sponsored relative in Canada, and meet the requirements of the sponsor.</p>
